## RASA internal temperature / humidity daemon

Part of the observatory software for the Warwick La Palma telescopes.

`sht35d` wraps a SHT35 temperature/humidity sensor and makes the latest measurement available for other services via Pyro.

`sht35` is a commandline utility that reports the latest measurement from the RASA sht35 sensor.

See [Software Infrastructure](https://github.com/warwick-one-metre/docs/wiki/Software-Infrastructure) for an overview of the W1m software architecture and instructions for developing and deploying the code.
